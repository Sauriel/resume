Technology is in my blood. Back in 2004, I made my first attempts with HTML, CSS and Flash before I decided to learn more about the basics of design by becoming a designer. But even when I worked in a few graphic design companies, web technologies never really let go of me and I decided to study computer science in 2012 to learn not only web design but also web development.

After my studies, I was lucky enough to get to know many new technologies and gain a reputation as a front-end expert at novomind AG. After working with jQuery and Angular.js, I finally landed on Vue.js and was given the task of leading the development of a new administration interface for our store system as a frontend architect in the international core team.

Now I am looking for new challenges to quench my thirst for knowledge and my love for the frontend. I love working in a solution-oriented way and finding creative and elegant solutions to complex problems.
